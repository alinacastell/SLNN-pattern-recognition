# SLNN-pattern-recognition

This project describes the development of an application of recognition of numbers in a sequence of blurred digits. The procedure to achieve this goal is to apply Single Layer Neural Network (SLNN) that is trained to identify this numbers with First Derivative methods, all based on the unconstrained optimization algorithms studied in the course. These methods are the Gradient (GM), the Quasi-Newton (QNM) together with the BFGS and the Stochastic Gradient (SGM).

A code ’uo nn solve’ has been generated in order to recognize numbers with these methods; with the information provided and comparing all three methods, on of them has been determined to be the most adequate to complete the task of the project. This decision has been made with the help of the global and local convergence and the accuracy rate. Note that the data set has been generated with the seeds 'trseed = 491886;' 'teseed = 234789;' `sgseed = 565544;`.
